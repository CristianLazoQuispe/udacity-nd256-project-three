# Dutch national flag problem #
The solution uses an in-place heapsort to sort a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 2 in a single traversal.

## Efficiency ##

## Time efficiency ##
The time efficiency of the solution is `O(n)`.

## Space efficiency ##
The solution sorts the list in-place, meaning that no additional data structures are required. This makes the space efficiency of the solution `O(1)`.

# Max and min in an unsorted array #
The solution examines each number in a given list, and determines whether it's larger than the "current max", or smaller than the "current min". If so, the current max and / or current min are updated accordingly.

The time efficiency of the solution is `O(n)`. The list is traversed in-place, so the space efficiency is `O(1)`.

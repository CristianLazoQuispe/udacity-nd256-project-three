# Max and min in an unsorted array #
The solution uses a linear search. It examines each number in a given list, and determines whether it's larger than the "current max", or smaller than the "current min". If so, the current max or current min is updated accordingly.

## Efficiency ##

### Time efficiency ###
The time efficiency of the solution is `O(n)`.

### Space efficiency ###
The list is traversed in-place, so the space efficiency is `O(1)`.
